# 3D-Maze
A console application written in C++.

Its a 3-Dimensional Maze environment created using characters and for navigation you can use the following keys 
W - forward
S - backwards
A - left
D - right

I watched a indepth tutorial on youtube created by Javidx9 and learned how C++ can be used to create 3D environments or games and also had clear understanding of many other concepts, thanks to javidx9, the way he implemented and presented those concepts on the app, the tutorial was simple and great to learn loved watching it, loved watching it.
