# 3D-Maze
A console application written in C++.

I watched a tutorial on youtube and understood how C++ can be used to create 3D environments or games and also had clear understanding of many other concepts, because of javidx9, the way he taught and presented those concepts.

The tutorial was simple and great to learn, thanks to Javidx9, lots of love.
